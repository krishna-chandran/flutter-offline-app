# Getting Started with Flutter and iOS Simulator on macOS

This guide will walk you through setting up a Flutter project and running it on the iOS Simulator on macOS.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) (for iOS development)

## 1. Install Flutter

1. Download the Flutter SDK from [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev).
2. Extract the archive and add the Flutter tool to your system path.
3. Open a terminal and run the following command to verify your Flutter installation:

   `flutter doctor`

4. Follow any setup instructions provided by `flutter doctor` to resolve missing dependencies.

## 2. Create a New Flutter Project

To create a new Flutter project, open a terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and run:

`flutter create my_flutter_app`

Replace `my_flutter_app` with your preferred project name.

Navigate into the project directory:

`cd my_flutter_app`

## 3. Install Xcode

1. Open the **App Store** on macOS.
2. Search for **Xcode** and install it.
3. Once installed, open Xcode to complete the setup.

### Accept Xcode License Agreement

After installing Xcode, accept the license agreement by running:

`sudo xcodebuild -license accept`

### Set Up Command Line Tools in Xcode

1. Open **Xcode**.
2. Go to **Preferences** > **Locations**.
3. Select the latest **Xcode version** under **Command Line Tools**.

## 4. Open the iOS Simulator

To open the iOS Simulator:

1. Open Xcode.
2. Go to **Xcode** > **Open Developer Tool** > **Simulator**.

Alternatively, you can open the simulator via the terminal with:

`open -a Simulator`

## 5. Verify Setup with `flutter doctor`

In the terminal, run:

`flutter doctor`

Ensure `flutter doctor` shows that all dependencies are installed, especially for iOS development.

## 6. Run the Flutter App on the iOS Simulator

1. Open your project in a terminal.
2. Make sure the iOS Simulator is running.
3. Run the Flutter app:

   `flutter run`

This should deploy the app to the iOS Simulator.

## 7. Development Workflow

With the app running on the simulator, you can use the following commands for efficient development:

- **Hot Reload**: Press `r` in the terminal or use the hot reload button in your editor to apply code changes without losing app state.
- **Hot Restart**: Press `R` in the terminal for a full restart.
